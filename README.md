# How do I approach designing software?

Generally, my approach to designing software is incremental because in order to build efficient, yet complex software, carefully planned steps must first be taken. In terms of new design skills that I have learned working on the final project in this class, I learned quite a bit of new code in relation to OpenGL that I was not aware of before. The design process that I followed in this course was linear in that I would always read the module's resources and announcements before completing the assignments. In terms of future work, I think this approach would also be effective because it entails learning how to properly build an application before attempting to build it from scratch.

# How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs generally in the same fashion that I mentioned above, incrementally, unless the program is very simple and requires no planning ahead of time. Iteration factored very much into the development of this program because I would run the program very frequently, similar to an experiment, to visually see the changes that I had made in code. My approach to developing the code didn't change much throughout the milestones, but as time passed, I understood more efficiently the purpose of each method and line of code. 

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Overall, the study of computer science has greatly sharpened my thinking and so has been a very good thing. The study of computational graphics and visualizations has broadened my knowledge of programming and what code has the ability to do. I am not entirely sure that I will pursue a professional pathway in this particular specialty, but I did very much enjoy building the final project, and seeing the results of the 3D scene that I had built, as each new line of code was added.
